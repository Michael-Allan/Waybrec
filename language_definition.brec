            - A jointer brings its referent on-way.
                / A pointer does not.
                - Waycasters may freely substitute a jointer for a pointer whenever they wish
                  the referent to be included in the way.

     Patch
    ───────
        / A command point.
        - It alters the way model at a given fractum (referent fractum)
          which it specifies by reference to the waysource.
        - Following is the sketch of a definition.

        deletion patch
            - `: delete …`
            - deletes the referent fractum from the way model
            - First term: mandatory.

        replacement patch
            - `: replace …`
            - replaces the referent fractum in the way model
            - first term
                - defaults (like elsewhere, mutatis mutandis)
                  to a pattern based on the head of the first child of the patch
                    - so the referent head would be unchanged,
                      or changed only trivially as the pattern formation allows


        ───────────────────────
         child insertion patch
        ┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈
            - A principal use case: ease of engagement declaration in recasts.

            prependage patch
                - `: prepend @ …`
                - Adds its children (to the way model) as the first children of the referent fractum.
                - First term: mandatory.

            appendage patch
                - `: append @ …`
                - Adds its children (to the way model) as the last children of the referent fractum.
                - First term: mandatory.


        ─────────────────────────
         sibling insertion patch
        ┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈
            precession patch
                - `: precede …`
                - inserts its children (to the way model) as siblings directly before the referent fractum
                - First term: mandatory.
            succession patch
                - `: succeed …`
                - appends its children (to the way model) as siblings directly after the referent fractum
                - First term: mandatory.

     Thoroughfractum designator
    ────────────────────────────
        / A command point.
        - It marks its parent as a thoroughfractum.
        - Its descriptor has this form:
